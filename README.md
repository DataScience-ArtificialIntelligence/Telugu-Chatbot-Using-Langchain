The advent of OpenAI and the evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) signify a pivotal moment in the
realm of Artificial Intelligence (AI). These sophisticated models, extensively trained on vast datasets, introduce a
paradigm shift in AI capabilities by delivering nuanced and creative responses. This transformative potential is
particularly evident in the domain of chatbots. In our project, we proudly present ’BrahmiBot’, 
a generativeinteractive model designed for Telugu, one of the oldest and widely spoken Indian languages.
’BrahmiBot’ harnesses the power of machine translation and the newly emerging ’LangChain’ library, with
Facebook-BlenderBot-400M at its core. This amalgamation results in a chatbot that not only understands but
also generates creative responses. The implementation of ’BrahmiBot’ is seamlessly integrated into a simple web
application created using the ’Flask’ library. The utilization of Telugu as the conversational medium makes
’BrahmiBot’ a fresh attempt at developing an Indian language based AI conversational agent.
